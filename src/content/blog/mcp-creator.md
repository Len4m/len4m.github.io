Hello, curious hackers and developers! 👋 

![MCP Server Creator](/assets/mcp-creator/OpenGraph.png)

> MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol that enables LLMs
> to connect with external tools, data sources, and systems.
> 
> [Official MCP documentation →](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/mcp)

I present to you the **MCP Server Creator**, a web tool that turns MCP server creation into something as easy as making coffee ☕ (well, almost). This tool is designed to **give superpowers to LLMs**, allowing them to execute binaries and scripts directly in the console and get results. It generates MCP server code in Node.js and Python that acts as a bridge between language models and your favorite command-line tools.

## ⚠️ Important disclaimer

Before you get too excited: this tool is for **proof of concept, learning, and experimental development**. I'm not responsible if you decide to use it for something you shouldn't. Use it responsibly and only in controlled environments. Thanks for your understanding! 🙏
