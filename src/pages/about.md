Hello, I'm Manel, known in the cybersecurity world as Lenam or LenamGenX. 

I am a developer and sys admin with over 30 years of experience. My first programming experience was as a child with the GW-BASIC language on a Spectrum and later on an Amstrad PC1512 (such memories), and since then I haven't stopped learning and will continue to do so.

I have my own company, which I will not disclose on this blog. I value anonymity and do not want to expose my company or clients to any mischievous black hat hackers. If you need my services, you can find me on Discord or send me e-mail.
